## 📋 THE SCRIPT

### PART 1: INTRO + RAPPORT (2 minutes)

**Your Opening:**
```
Hey [Name], thanks for making time!

Quick context: This is 20 minutes. I'm validating an idea before I spend 
6 months building it. I need brutally honest feedback - not politeness.

There's no right or wrong answers. I'm trying to figure out if this solves 
a real problem or if I'm just overengineering my own workflow.

Cool? Let's dive in.
```

**Q1: The Icebreaker**
```
"First - how did you find my post? What made you respond?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Which part resonated
- Their motivation level
- Initial interest signal

**Probe:**
- "What specifically caught your attention?"

**Why this question:**
- Warms them up
- Tests messaging effectiveness
- Shows what hook worked

---

**Q2: The Context Setter**
```
"Quick snapshot: How many notes do you have, and what percentage 
would you say is actually organized?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Scale (100s vs 1,000s vs 10,000s)
- Organization percentage (be honest!)
- Tone (embarrassed? proud? neutral?)

**Probe:**
- "Is that more or less than you'd like?"

**Why this question:**
- Establishes baseline
- Tests problem severity
- Gets them comfortable with honesty

---

### PART 2: PAIN DISCOVERY (4 minutes)

**Q3: The Frustration Finder**
```
"What part of your note-taking workflow makes you want to flip a table?"
```

**Listen for:**
- INTENSITY of emotion
- Specific pain points
- Frequency of frustration

**Probe:**
- "How often does this happen?"
- "What have you tried to fix it?"

**Why this question:**
- Tests emotional pain (buying signal)
- Identifies specific problems
- Reveals failed solutions

**🚨 RED FLAG:** If they say "nothing really" → Problem isn't real for them

---

**Q4: The Fantasy Solution**
```
"Complete this sentence: 'I wish my notes would just...'"
```

**Listen for:**
- Their ideal scenario
- Gaps in current tools
- What they'd pay for

**Probe:**
- "Why don't they do that now?"
- "What would change if they did?"

**Why this question:**
- Uncovers wish list
- Tests feature appeal
- Reveals value perception

---

**Q5: The Consequence Test**
```
"Tell me about a time you couldn't find an important note when you needed it. 
What happened?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Real-world consequences
- Economic impact
- Emotional impact

**Probe:**
- "How did that feel?"
- "Does this happen often?"

**Why this question:**
- Validates urgency
- Quantifies cost of problem
- Tests must-solve vs nice-to-solve

**🚨 RED FLAG:** If they can't think of a time → Problem isn't urgent

---

**Q6: The System Deep-Dive**
```
"Walk me through organizing a meeting note from capture to final location. 
What's the most annoying part?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Workflow steps
- Friction points
- Time investment

**Probe:**
- "How long does that take?"
- "Which step makes you procrastinate?"

**Why this question:**
- Maps current workflow
- Identifies bottlenecks
- Tests automation opportunity

---

### PART 3: SOLUTION VALIDATION (4 minutes)

**Q7: The Feature Reaction**
```
"Okay, here's what I'm thinking of building:

AI that organizes your notes automatically, but YOU control what it sees.

Like:
- 'This is a public blog idea' → Cloud AI can see it
- 'This is my therapy journal' → Only local AI, or block entirely
- 'This is client work' → Local AI only, with audit logs

Immediate gut reaction - what do you think?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Instant response (excitement? confusion? skepticism?)
- Which part they react to first
- Questions they ask

**Probe:**
- "What part excites you? What part concerns you?"

**Why this question:**
- Tests core value prop
- Identifies resonance
- Surfaces objections early

---

**Q8: The Use Case Test**
```
"Can you think of a specific note you created THIS WEEK that this 
would have helped with?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Concrete example (good signal)
- "Um, maybe..." (weak signal)
- "Not really" (bad signal)

**Probe:**
- "How would it have helped?"
- "How often does that happen?"

**Why this question:**
- Tests real-world applicability
- Validates frequency
- Confirms use case fit

**🚨 RED FLAG:** If they can't think of one → Solution doesn't fit workflow

---

**Q9: The One Feature Rule**
```
"I can only build ONE feature for the first version. Which matters most?

A) Privacy controls (you choose what AI sees)
B) Entity extraction (auto-create people/project pages)
C) Progressive organization (48hr delay, you approve)
D) Local AI support (nothing sent to cloud)
E) Graph visualization (see relationships)

Pick ONE."
```

**Listen for:**
- Immediate choice (conviction)
- Hesitation (unclear value)
- "Can I pick two?" (feature appetite)

**Probe:**
- "Why that one?"
- "Would you use it without the others?"

**Why this question:**
- Forces prioritization
- Tests feature hierarchy
- Validates MVP scope

---

**Q10: The Adoption Barrier**
```
"What would make you NOT try this, even if it was free?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Deep objections
- Deal-breakers
- Fear factors

**Probe:**
- "Is there anything that would overcome that?"

**Why this question:**
- Surfaces fatal flaws
- Tests objection severity
- Identifies must-haves

---

### PART 4: PRIVACY DEEP-DIVE (4 minutes)

**Q11: The Privacy Scope**

like, you'd never want them sent to OpenAI?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Percentage (10%? 50%? 90%?)
- Types of sensitive notes
- Privacy awareness

**Probe:**
- "What makes them private?"
- "How do you protect them now?"

**Why this question:**
- Quantifies privacy need
- Tests market size
- Validates differentiation

**🚨 RED FLAG:** If they say "5% or less" → Privacy not a differentiator for them

---

**Q12: The Privacy Control Test**
```
"Would you want to approve EVERY AI operation, or set rules once 
and let it run automatically?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Control preference
- Trust level
- Convenience trade-off

**Probe:**
- "Why?"

**Why this question:**
- Tests UX preference
- Validates privacy model
- Identifies user segments

---

**Q13: The Local AI Reality**
```
"Be honest - have you ever used local AI? Like Ollama or LMStudio?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Technical capability
- Prior experience
- Setup tolerance

**Probe:**
- (If yes) "How was that experience?"
- (If no) "Would you be willing to try?"

**Why this question:**
- Tests technical sophistication

"What would make you trust a new tool with your entire vault?"

---

### PART 5: PRICING REALITY CHECK (3 minutes)

**Why this question:**

---

**Q16: The Price Comparison**
```
"What do you currently pay for productivity tools? Monthly total."
```

**Listen for:**

**Probe:**
- "Are you getting your money's worth?"
- "Is there room for another tool?"

**Why this question:**
- Establishes baseline
- Tests budget reality
- Validates pricing tier

---

**Q17: The Van Westendorp**
```
"Quick rapid-fire - four pricing questions. First number that comes to mind:

1. At what price would this be too cheap to be good?
2. At what price would it be a great deal?
3. At what price is it getting expensive but you'd still consider it?
4. At what price is it too expensive - won't even consider?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Price range
- Consistency
- Confidence

**Record:**
- Too cheap: $_____

**Why this question:**

---

### PART 6: THE MONEY QUESTION (2 minutes)

**Q18: THE MOMENT OF TRUTH**
```
"Okay. Hypothetically:

This launches tomorrow. $99 one-time OR $7/month.

Would you buy it?"
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL: WAIT FOR THEIR ANSWER. DON'T FILL THE SILENCE.**

**Listen for:**
- Immediate "yes" (STRONG BUY)
- "Probably" (MAYBE)
- "Maybe" (WEAK)
- "No" (NO)
- Hesitation length

**Probe (based on answer):**
- If YES: "What would you need to see before purchasing?"
- If PROBABLY: "What would move you from 'probably' to 'yes'?"
- If MAYBE: "What's your biggest hesitation?"
- If NO: "Is it the price, features, or something else?"

**Why this question:**
- THE validation moment
- Tests true intent
- Reveals objections

---

**Q19: The Commitment Test**
```
"If I offered 50% off for early supporters who pre-order, 
would you put money down today?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Immediate commitment
- Hesitation
- Conditions

**Probe:**
- "What would you need to see first?"

**Why this question:**
- Tests REAL commitment
- Separates interest from intent
- Validates pre-order potential

**🎯 GOLD STANDARD:** If they say yes → Ask for email to send invoice

---

### PART 7: CLOSE + NEXT STEPS (1 minute)

**Q20: The Wrap-Up**
```
"This has been incredibly valuable. Three quick things:

1. Can I add you to the beta list? (When I build it, you get early access)
2. Can I use a quote from our chat on the landing page?
3. If I email you in 2 weeks with an update, would you respond?

Any questions for me?"
```

**Then:**
