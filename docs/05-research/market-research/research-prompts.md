## Research Objective

Conduct comprehensive competitive intelligence analysis of the Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) and note-taking ecosystem to inform Second Brain Foundation's positioning, feature prioritization, and go-to-market strategy. This research will identify competitive advantages, market gaps, and strategic opportunities for differentiation.

## Background Context

**Project Summary:** Second Brain Foundation is an open-source PKM framework featuring:
- AI-augmented progressive organization (relationship-first, structure-second)
- Context-aware privacy model (tiered sensitivity with cloud vs local AI permissions)
- Markdown-based, tool-agnostic foundation (Obsidian, NotebookLM, AnythingLLM compatibility)
- Entity-based knowledge management (People, Places, Topics, Projects)
- 48-hour lifecycle for notes transitioning from capture to permanent structure

**Key Differentiators:**
- Progressive organization that mirrors human cognition
- Privacy-first design with context-aware sensitivity controls
- No vendor lock-in (pure markdown + frontmatter metadata)
- Local-first architecture with optional cloud AI
- Nature-inspired organizational principles applied to familiar methods

**Target Users:** Knowledge workers, researchers, developers, consultants, product managers, academics, creative professionals (age 22-55, technically comfortable)

**MVP Scope:** Specification-focused framework with manual workflow, preparing for future AEI (AI-Enabled Interface) automation
