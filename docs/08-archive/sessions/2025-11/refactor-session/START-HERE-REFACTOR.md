# 📋 START HERE - Refactor Re-Alignment Index

**Date:** 2025-11-24  
**Purpose:** Navigation guide for the corrective refactor  
**Status:** ✅ ANALYSIS COMPLETE, READY FOR YOUR REVIEW

---

## 🎯 Quick Summary (TLDR)

### The Problem:
Previous refactor went **cloud-first microservices** instead of **local-first hybrid**.

### Your Vision (from your documents):
- **Local vault files** = canonical (U1 - highest truth)
- **Desktop app** = primary interface
- **Cloud API** = secondary (sync, backup, AI suggestions)
- **Truth Hierarchy:** U1 > A2 > L3 > LN4 > C5
- **AI cannot overwrite user** without approval

### The Solution:
Complete re-alignment with foundation packages, desktop app restoration, and truth-aware sync.
